Welcome,

The current project is my Python progression diary.
I am due to graduate from the MSc in Psychology Research Methods with Data Science at the University of Sheffield in
January 2022.
I have decided to continue my data science future by learning Python in addition to R (my MSc only included R coding).

The project will be complete, it will include raw data, scripts, documentation and visualisations when applicable.
Moreover, it will allow for the replication and understand of all steps and processes.

I will utilize free resources across the internet, and I will make appropriate references whenever possible.

If you wish to add to my Python progression journey (or my R progression journey) feel free to contact me.
I am always interested in learning more!

attic = code that I used to play around with, or code that I do not want to delete as I might need it later on
data = contains two folders (processed and raw) and my codebook
