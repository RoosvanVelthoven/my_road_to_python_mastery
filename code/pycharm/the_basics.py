# To run code use the short cut shift F10 (on Windows)
print("I am Roos van Velthoven")

# Note: we can use single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ".

# We have different types of code in Python.

# Expressions: expressions are code that produces a value.
# Variables: variables store data (temporarily) in a computers memory.

# Integer: a integer is a number without a decimal point.
# Float (floating point number): a float is a number with a decimal point.
# Boolean: a boolean is a true of false statement.

# What happens if we run the below expression?
print("!" * 5)

# ! gets multiplied five times.

# What happens if we run the below variable?
age = 24

print(age)

# print(age) gives us the value 24 which we had coded in our memory.

# What happens if we run print("age")?

print("age")

# The terminal prints the string age.

# Exercise:
# We have a new student named Roos van Velthoven.
# She is 24 years old.
# Create three variables using the above information.

new_student = True
name = "Roos van Velthoven"
age = 24
