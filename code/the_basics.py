# Step one: install Python
# https://www.python.org/

# Note: Add Python to Path

# Step two: install a code editor
# Code editors are used to write code.

# Note: My road to Python mastery will start with the code editor known as Pycharm.
# https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
# Pycharm is considered an IDE (integrated development environment).
# Pycharm has additional features which should make it easier to write code.

# Step three: create a project and a new Python file.

# Note: Python files by convention end in .py.
